					<h2>This is a trailor...</h2>
					<p>Hello World, this is DevWithMe's JavaScript Tutorial for beginners for free.</p>
					<h2>Why JS?</h2>
					<p>If you have any previous programming experience before, most of them need either need to compile your program, need specific-interpreter or need download library files. Well, JavaScript is non of those. You don't need to do any of these, all you need is click command-option-J/control-shift-J (at chrome) to open up your browser's JavaScript console, and you can start type your JS codes there.</p>
					<h2>What can you do with JS?</h2>
					<p>Because it can make your webpage more interactive, it can create interactive games, and it can create natural simulations.</p>
					<h2>Resources</h2>
					<p>Beside this channel, there are also following website that have great resources on JavaScript: (and yes, all the resources are available to public for FREE!)</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">khanacademy.org</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://pepa.holla.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JavaScript-A-Beginners-Guide-Fourth-Edition1.pdf">Ebook (will be used throughout this tutorial)</a></li>

					<h2>Where is JavaScript Console?</h2>
					<p>JavaScript console is available on almost every browser, in this tutorial, I'm using Macbook's Google Chrome. However, if you want to Safari, you may need to configure some firewall security information. For more information, click this <a href="https://www.wickedlysmart.com/hfhtml5/devtools.html">link</a></p>
					<p>To open up JS console in Macbook, click command-option-J; in Windows, click control-shift-J.</p>
					<h2>Basic Console Logs/Messages</h2>
					<p>In WebDev JS, the first line of code you will learn is: <code>console.log</code>.</p>
					<p>For example, if you type <code>console.log("hello world")</code> you will see <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boyuan12/DevWithMe/master/Files/JS/Video%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20JS/result%20of%20console.log(%22hello%20world%22).png" alt="hello world" width="300"> as result.</p>
					<p>You have different way to create console messages, such as shown in the picture: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boyuan12/DevWithMe/master/Files/JS/Video%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20JS/differ%20console%20messages.png" alt="differ console messages" width="300"></p>
					<h2>Variable</h2>
					<p>Variable is important concept in every programming language, no exception on JavaScript. There are 3 ways to declare variables:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>var</code>This is the oldest way to declare variable in JavaScript, you can reassign the value of this variable.</li>
						<li><code>const</code>This is one of new version of JavaScript variables. This declare a constant variable, which means the value is not reassignable.</li>
						<li><code>let</code>This is one of new version of JavaScript variable. This declare a variable that cannot reassign under "normal" condition, however, you can reassign this variable inside of a loop, or not "normal" environment.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Data Types</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>number</li>
						<li>string</li>
						<li>boolean</li>
						<li>null</li>
						<li>undefined</li>
						<li>object</li>
						<li>symbol</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>One more console property...</h2>
					<p>You can use <code>typeof</code> property inside of your console to identify the type of the "things" that you are trying to identify.</p>

          <h2>Where to put JS?</h2>
          <p>Just like CSS, you must know where to put JS codes before you can actually execute codes. There are 2 ways you can put your JS codes, you can put your code</p>
        </article>

          <h2>Where to put JS?</h2>
          <p>Just like CSS, we must know where to put JS codes before they can actual get executed. There are 2 ways that you can put JS codes, you can create <code>&ltscript&gt</code> inside of your HTML document, or you can link an enternal JS script using <code>&ltscript src=""&gt</code></p>
          <h2>alert, confirm and prompt box</h2>
          <p>Recall you might see an alert box like this: </p>
          <img src="../Files/JS/Video 2 - Basic JavaScript/example alert message.png" width="200">
          <p>We will learn how to create an alert box similar to that, open up your JS console (cmd-opt-j; ctrl-shift-j), then type following codes:</p>
          <code>alert("this is an example alert");</code>
          <p>You should see something like this: </p>
          <img src="../Files/JS/Video 2 - Basic JavaScript/alert.png" width="200">
          <p>However, sometimes the alert box may need more than 1 button (such as shown in first image), we will need a new property:</p>
          <code>confirm("Press a button");</code>
          <img src="../Files/JS/Video 2 - Basic JavaScript/confirm.png" width="200">
          <p>Finally, there are not only alert box that have buttons, you can also type input, try these codes:</p>
          <code>prompt("What is your name");</code>
          <img src="../Files/JS/Video 2 - Basic JavaScript/prompt.png" width="200">
          <h2>document.write</h2>
          <p>This is an example of DOM (Document Object Model) Modification. I will talk in deeper on what is DOM on further video. But for now, you can just remember this create a new paragraph in your HTML document.</p>
          <h2>Comment in JS</h2>
          <p>Remember you can comment in HTML & CSS? You can also do this is Javascript! This will not render by interpreter it self, but for human to understand your codes better. You can use // for single line comment; /* */ for multi-line comments</p>

          <h2>Variable Review</h2>
          <p>Recall in ES6, you have three way to declare variable: <span style="background-color: rgb(247,247,247); font-size:87.5%;color:#e83e8c;">var, let, const</span>. See more info, watch first video. We also learned types of the values.</p>
          <h2>Name a variable</h2>
          <p>In order to name a variable, your variable name must follow:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First letter MUST be a letter or _</li>
            <li>Must ONLY use letter, number and _</li>
            <li>It is case sensitive</li>
            <li>No length limitation</li>
            <li>No reserve words usage</li>
          </ul>
					<h2>A little bit on operator</h2>
					<p>The + operator in JS has 2 usage, one is add two or more strings together, second is to actually add number, just like in regular arithmetic.</p>

					<h1>Function 1 | Video 4</h1>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oT3DE7BGK80" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<h2>function vs function (syntax)</h2>
					<p>In algebra, you learned a function is something like this: f(x) = 2x + 6, where f means it's a function, x is an input, 2x + 6 is the rule of that function. JS function is similar, to create a function, you will type:</p>
					<code>function <i>function_name</i>() { }; </code>
					<p>The style of function's name are same as variable's style. When you name a function, make sure your function's name matches that result, or output of that function.</p>
					<h2>Basic Function</h2>
					<p>Click this <a href="https://github.com/boyuan12/DevWithMe/blob/master/JSTutorial/JS/Video%204%20-%20Function%201/function1.html">link</a> to see a simple function.</p>
					<p>At line 18, you should saw a line of code</p>
					<code>hello_world();</code>
					<p>Guess what did it do?</p>
					<h2>Calling a function</h2>
					<p>In JS, you must call a function when you want to use. In a form like <i>function_name</i>()</p>
					<h2>Argument/paramenter</h2>
					<p>Ever wonder what should be inside of ()? You will put argument/parameter inside of it. For example, if you want to create an variable that you want use in that function, you can put variable name (DON'T put variable keywords) inside. As shown in <a href="https://github.com/boyuan12/DevWithMe/blob/master/JSTutorial/JS/Video%204%20-%20Function%201/function3.html">function3.html</a>.</p>
					<p>This is similar to the x value, or input in algebra. In JS, when you call this function, make sure you provide correct usage of parameter(s) in the ().</p>
					<h2>Return</h2>
					<p>Take a look <a href="https://github.com/boyuan12/DevWithMe/blob/master/JSTutorial/JS/Video%204%20-%20Function%201/function4.html">function4.html</a>. There is a difference compare to function3.html, what is the difference?</p>
					<p>The difference is in line 10, I added a return statement, this statement change the whole function into a value, by which return stated. (line 13 is optional)</p>
					<p>If you are still confusing, you may copy the code into your console, and take a look. You should see "You live at least 3650 days." as output.</p>

					<h1>Function 2 | Video 5</h1>
					<h2>Scope/Context Basics</h2>
					<p>Scope is the context in which a variable/function is valid, for example, if you declare variable inside of a function, it's only available inside of a function.</p>
					<p>To demostrate that, click this <a href="../JS/Video 5 - Function 2/global.html">link</a>, then go to your console to see the output.</p>
					<p>You should see John and an error saying mydog is not defined. That's because mydog is defined inside of that function, it only valid when it's used inside of the function, not valid otherwise.</p>

					<h1>Conditional Statement 1 | Video 6</h1>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VsVuOOlCh0I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<h2>Real-world example...</h2>
					<p>	You may have heard of this statement before:
						"<b>If</b> you review for your test effectively, <b>then</b> you may get better score. <b>Otherwise</b> you will receive a lower score on your test."</p>
					<p>	Conditional Statement is exactly just that, it's execute different code based on the conditions. But before we actually create some codes, I want to clear some terminology first.</p>
					<h2>= == ===</h2>
					<p>= means assign in variable.</p><br>
					<p>== comparison of equal to (doesn't have to be same type)</p>
					<p>=== comparison of equal to (must be the same type)</p>
					<h2>If...</h2>
					<p>First statement you will learn is if statement, it only work if the condition is true, copy and paste the codes to the console here:</p>
					<code>const a = 0; if (a === 0) {console.log("a is 0");}</code>
					<p>You should see a is 0 as output.</p>
					<h2>If... else ...</h2>
					<p>This kind of condition also works when if is not true, it's going to execute else. Take a look on following codes:</p>
					<code>var reviewTest === true; if (reviewTest === true) {console.log("Good score");} else {console.log("Bad Score");}</code>
					<p>You should saw "Good score" as output.</p>
					<h2>if... if .. else .. else ...</h2>
					<p>This is called nested code. Basically, you add another condition inside of if part. Take a look of this code for example: </p>
					<cod>var reviewTest === true; var efficient = false; if (reviewTest === true) {if (effcient === true){console.log("Good"); } else {console.log("Bad");}} else {console.log("Bad Score");}</code>
					<p>You should see "bad" as return</p>
					<h2>if ... else if... else</h2>
					<p>I didn't mention this in the video, but what this does is if the if statement is false, then it's going to execute else if, if this return false, it will execute else. Try to create a statement on your own.</p>
